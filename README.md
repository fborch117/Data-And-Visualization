# Data-And-Visualization

Hi there, 

My name is Foster Borch. I currently work as a Right of Way Agent with the State of Vermont's Agency of Transportation. 
My current role focuses heavily on the use of CAD and GIS software.

I relish any opportunity to take seemingly meaningless data and create visualizations from the noise. I see the incredible
power in geospatial analysis software, and it's something I use in my professional and personal life. 

This repository acts as a location to organize my visualizations. Some of these products have errors. Some I am proud of.
I enjoy nothing more than criticism, feedback, and the ability to improve my craft.

I hope you enjoy!
