Foster Borch's Visualization Repository
#Introduction
Hello there! My name is Foster Borch, and I am currently working as a Right of Way Agent with the State of Vermont's Agency of Transportation. In my role, I extensively utilize CAD and GIS software to analyze and visualize data.

I am a skilled PowerApps developer and experienced data analyst proficient in R, SAS, and Python. I relish any opportunity to take seemingly meaningless data and create visualizations from the noise. I see the incredible power in geospatial analysis software, and it's something I use in my professional and personal life.

#Repository Purpose
This repository serves as a central location for organizing and sharing my visualizations. Here, you will find a collection of my work, ranging from CAD and GIS visualizations to data analyses using R, SAS, and Python. 

#Feedback and Collaboration
Some of these products have errors, while others showcase my expertise in PowerApps development and data analysis. I believe that collaboration and learning from others is crucial for growth. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions regarding any of the visualizations or data analyses in this repository, please feel free to reach out. I am open to discussing methodologies, sharing insights, and exploring potential collaborative opportunities.

#Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to visit my visualization repository. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy creating it. Together, let's strive for continuous improvement and push the boundaries of what data visualization and analysis can achieve.
